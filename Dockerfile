# A headless outl peer: `outl serve`, holding this device's iroh endpoint so
# your other devices converge whether or not any two of them are awake at the
# same time. It is a full replica — the op log is the source of truth and this
# box has all of it — not a "cloud" that owns your notes.
#
# Read docs/self-hosting.md before running it. Two things there are not
# guessable from this file: the workspace has to JOIN your graph (never host
# the pairing), and the two persistent volumes are not optional.

# Deliberately NOT $OUTL_DEVICE_DIR: that variable means "throwaway actor" and

# Two volumes, and they are two for a reason the project treats as an

# replicated to every peer; /home/outl is what makes this container one
# device rather than a new one on every restart.
VOLUME ["/data", "/home/outl"]

# Non-root, and never root — not even for a chown-then-drop entrypoint.
# `docker exec` bypasses the entrypoint, so a drop would put the documented
# `docker compose exec outl outl peer pair` on the root side of it, writing
# `identity.key` and `peers.json` as root and locking the daemon out of its
# own identity. A bind mount therefore needs one `chown -R 1000:1000` on the
# host; named volumes inherit the ownership set above and need nothing.

STOPSIGNAL SIGTERM

# No HEALTHCHECK on purpose. The obvious probes are both harmful here:
# `outl workspace info` takes the per-actor write lock, loses it to the
# running daemon, and mints a fresh ephemeral `ops-<ulid>.jsonl` on every
# probe; `outl peer status` binds an endpoint and fights the daemon for the
# device lease. Liveness is the process, and the daemon exits non-zero when
# its watcher dies — let the restart policy do the work.
