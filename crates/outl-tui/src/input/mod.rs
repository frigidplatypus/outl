//! Key-event routing: turn a [`crossterm::event::KeyEvent`] into a
//! method call on `crate::state::App`.
//!
//! Each `handle_*_key` function pattern-matches a key, decides which
//! action to invoke, and returns. They never render; they never read
//! or write files directly; they delegate everything to methods on
//! `App` (defined in [`crate::actions`]).
//!
//! Keymap *documentation* (the table users care about) lives in
//! [`crate::keymap`].
//!
//! ## Multi-line editing inside a block (Insert mode)
//!
//! `Alt+Enter` inserts a soft newline — the cursor stays inside the
//! same block, so users can write multi-line bullets and fenced code
//! blocks (e.g. ` ```lisp `…` ``` `). Plain `Enter` commits the block
//! and creates a sibling below.
//!
//! Terminals that speak the kitty keyboard protocol (kitty, wezterm,
//! alacritty, Ghostty, foot, recent iTerm2) also accept `Shift+Enter`
//! for the same action; older terminals (Terminal.app, plain xterm)
//! collapse `Shift+Enter` into `Enter`, which is why `Alt+Enter` is
//! the portable fallback. The keyboard-enhancement push happens in
//! [`crate::runtime`].
//!
//! ## Module layout
//!
//! | Submodule  | What's in it                                                 |
//! |------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
//! | `normal`   | `handle_normal_key` — selection, chords, mode switches       |
//! | `insert`   | `handle_insert_key` — text edits, soft newlines, cross-block |
//! | `overlay`  | `handle_overlay_key` + quick-switch / search / command / slash |
//! | `visual`   | `handle_visual_key` — range ops over selected blocks         |
//! | `sidebar`  | `handle_sidebar_key` — event-loop chrome: sidebar/backlinks   |
//! |            | chords + keystroke routing while sidebar focus is held        |
//!
//! Shared helpers (`cross_block_step`, `cross_block_nav_eligible`,
//! `cursor_inside_open_fence`) live here in `mod.rs` so every
//! submodule can `use super::*`.
