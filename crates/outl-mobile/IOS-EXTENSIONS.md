# iOS app extensions (RFC 0363)

Capture from outside the app: a widget, an App Intent ("Add to today",
which Shortcuts, Siri and the Action button use) and a share extension.
Design and invariants: [`docs/rfcs/0363-ios-quick-capture.md`](../../docs/rfcs/0363-ios-quick-capture.md).

## What lives where

| Piece | Path | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Widget (opens `outl://capture`) | `src-tauri/gen/apple/OutlWidget/` | `OutlWidget` app extension, iOS 16+ |
| Shared pure logic (links, inbox writer, ULID) | `swift/OutlKit/Sources/OutlKit/Capture/` | OutlKit package, unit tested by `swift test` |
| App Intent "Add to today" + App Shortcut | `src-tauri/gen/apple/Sources/outl-mobile/OutlAddToTodayIntent.swift` | app, iOS 16+ (`AppIntents` weak-linked) |
| Share extension (text, one web link) | `src-tauri/gen/apple/OutlShare/` | `OutlShare` app extension, iOS 15+ |
| App bridge (inbox path, arrival notification) | `src-tauri/gen/apple/Sources/outl-mobile/OutlCaptureInbox.swift` | app |
| Drain | `outl_actions::capture`, `outl-tauri-shared/src/capture_inbox.rs` (`drain_capture_inbox`) | Rust, tested on Linux |
| When to drain | `src/components/Journal.inbox.ts` (mount, foreground, `__outlCapturesArrived`) | webview |

The `iOS N+` column is the **API** each piece needs, not the floor the app
ships with: the deployment target is **iOS 17**, declared in
`src-tauri/gen/apple/project.yml`, the committed `project.pbxproj`,
`tauri.conf.json` and `swift/OutlKit/Package.swift` (all four, or a build
picks the lowest and an `#available` branch nobody tests comes back).

The App Group is `group.app.outl.mobile-app`; the inbox is `captures/` in
its container. The app and every extension that writes must carry it.

The extension targets were added to the committed `project.pbxproj` by
`scripts/ios-add-extension.py`; `project.yml` mirrors them for anyone who
regenerates with `xcodegen`.

## What CI checks and what it cannot

- `swift (OutlKit unit tests)` runs on every PR: the pure Swift pieces.
- `iOS Simulator build (opt-in)` (run it from the Actions tab, or label the
  PR `ios-build`) compiles the app with its extensions for the simulator,
  unsigned.
- The release job signs each extension with its own profile, or, when a
  profile secret is missing, unhooks the extensions and ships the app
  alone (`scripts/ios-extensions-signing.py`).

## What needs Xcode on a Mac

1. **Apple Developer portal.** Create the App Group
   `group.app.outl.mobile-app`. Register the App IDs
   `app.outl.mobile-app.widget` and `app.outl.mobile-app.share`. Enable
   App Groups on `app.outl.mobile-app` and on the share App ID, both with
   that group.
2. **Regenerate the app's App Store profile** so it includes the App
   Group, and update `PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64`. The release job drops
   the App Group from the app (and unhooks the extensions) while any
   extension profile secret is missing, so nothing breaks before this.
3. **Extension App Store profiles.** One per extension. Add them as repository
   secrets `WIDGET_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64` and
   `SHARE_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64` (base64 of the `.mobileprovision`).
   Until both exist, release builds ship without the extensions.
4. **Run on a device.** Open `src-tauri/gen/apple/outl-mobile.xcodeproj`,
   pick your team on each extension target (Signing & Capabilities), run
   the `outl-mobile_iOS` scheme on a phone, then add the "Add to today"
   widget from the Home Screen and the Lock Screen and tap it: the app
   should open on the capture sheet.
5. **Inbox on a device.** With the app in the background, use the
   "Add to today" Shortcut (step 3) or share some text to outl: the line
   should be in today's journal when you open the app, and with the app
   open it should appear within a second (Darwin notification).
