/// Current sidecar format version.
///
/// Version history:
/// - **1** — initial format (page_id, last_synced_hash, blocks with id /
///   line / indent / content_hash).
/// - **2** — `ref_handle` on every block to power `((blk-XXXXXX))`
///   inline references. Backward-compatible read: v1 sidecars load fine
///   and their handles are derived on the fly from the block id.
///   Later **additive** fields ride along at this same version:
///   `pipeline_version` on the payload, [`SidecarBlock::text`] on every
///   block. See the bump rule below for why they did not move the
///   number.
///
/// # When to bump — and when not to
///
/// The version answers exactly one question for a reader that did not
/// write the file: *can I still trust the fields I know?* Compatibility
/// runs in **both** directions, and the two directions are not
/// symmetric.
///
/// - **Backward** — this binary reading an older payload. Always
///   supported, down to [`MIN_READABLE_SIDECAR_VERSION`]. A read path is
///   never dropped when a newer one lands.
/// - **Forward** — an *already shipped* binary reading a payload this
///   one wrote. Every released binary rejects
///   `version > its own SIDECAR_VERSION`, and that rejection cannot be
///   patched retroactively. On the paths that consume a sidecar, an
///   unreadable one used to look exactly like a missing one: no old
///   blocks, so every block matched at level 3, got a fresh ULID, and
///   the old id stayed in the tree — one boot of a stale device on a
///   shared iCloud folder duplicated the whole workspace and broke
///   every `((blk-…))` handle. The devices in one workspace never
///   update at the same instant (TestFlight lag, a laptop closed for a
///   week), so this is a real user, not a hypothetical one.
///
/// Hence the rule:
///
/// - **An additive field does NOT bump the version.** Give it
///   `#[serde(default)]` and the format stays readable in both
///   directions: an older reader ignores the unknown JSON key, a newer
///   reader treats "missing" as "feature off for this entry".
///   `pipeline_version` and [`SidecarBlock::text`] are both this shape.
///   **Feature detection is per-field presence, never per version
///   number** — an empty `text` disables level-2 matching for that
///   block whatever the number on the file says, which is also the only
///   correct answer once an old binary rewrites the sidecar and drops
///   the field it never knew about.
/// - **Bump only when an older reader would _misread_ the file** — an
///   existing field changes meaning, changes encoding, or goes away.
///   There the old binary's [`SidecarError::UnsupportedVersion`] is the
///   *desired* outcome: a loud refusal beats silent corruption, and
///   `reconcile_md` propagates that error instead of rebuilding the
///   page from scratch.
/// - A bump is a coordinated release, not a patch. It needs a migration
///   note in `docs/markdown-format.md` and an `outl doctor` path,
///   because every device that has not updated stops reconciling those
///   pages until it does.
///
/// Note: the sidecar is intentionally **only structural metadata**
/// (ids, position, content hashes, ref handles, last-synced text). Any
/// state that needs to *converge between devices* — collapsed/folded
/// blocks, future per-block flags — goes through the `Op` log in
/// `outl-core`, not here. The sidecar is a projection cache for
