# This file is maintained by `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
# Every push to `main` runs the release workflow, which bumps the
# `version` line (computed from `Cargo.toml` + the workflow run
# number), the bottle `root_url`, and the six `sha256` lines below in
# place. The `# anchor:` comments are how the workflow finds the right
# lines — do not remove them.
#
# Values committed here are bootstrap placeholders: `version "0.0.0"`
# and zeroed SHAs make `brew install outl-beta` fail loudly until the
# first release fires. They become real on the next push to `main`.

  # We ship pre-built binaries and compile nothing here, but a formula
  # without a bottle counts as "build from source" to Homebrew, which
  # then runs its fatal dev-tools checks and refuses to install on any
  # Mac whose Xcode is older than the running macOS wants:
  #
  #   Error: Your Xcode (26.6) at /Applications/Xcode.app is too outdated.
  #
  # The bottles below are the same binaries repacked into the Cellar
  # layout (`outl-beta/<version>/bin/outl`), which makes `pour_bottle?`
  # true and skips those checks entirely. macOS bottle tags fall back to
  # older releases, so one `ventura` tag per arch covers every macOS
  # from 13 upwards — no runner on the newest macOS required.
