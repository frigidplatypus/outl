/**
 * Everything the journal listens to from outside the webview — the
 * platform-wiring half of issue #265 phase 3.
 *
 * Three listeners, one shape, and that shape has exactly one
 * implementation: {@link armCleanup}. It arms `onCleanup` **synchronously**
 * so the handle is torn down even if the component unmounts before the
 * dynamic `import()` resolves, then disposes a late-arriving handle on the
 * spot. Registering cleanup inside the `.then()` instead leaks the listener
 * on a fast unmount, and it is invisible until something unmounts — which
 * on mobile is "never" right up until it isn't.
 *
 * `Journal.listeners.test.ts` drives that window directly: it holds the
 * dynamic import open, unmounts, and then releases it. It also keeps the
 * callback each `listen()` was handed, so the listener **bodies** are
 * driven too — without that, the mid-edit guard below, the
 * `workspace-ready` branch and the refusal routing could all be deleted
 * with the suite still green.
 *
 * Every function here must be called from inside the component body:
 * `onCleanup` needs a Solid owner, and there is deliberately no
 * `runWithOwner` wrapper hiding that requirement.
