//! Re-import safety: is this destination safe to write a graph into?
//!
//! Two questions, answered separately because the evidence differs.
//!
//! 1. **Is there content here already?** Measured against the op log's
//!    materialized tree, never against the `.md` files. A workspace
//!    paired over iroh holds every op but projects a page's file only
//!    when that page is opened, so counting files sees an empty folder
//!    on a device that holds the whole graph.
//! 2. **Is that content the user's, or the wreckage of an import that
//!    died halfway?** The second is recorded by [`IMPORT_MARKER`] and
//!    must not demand `--force`, or the only way to recover from a
//!    failed import is the flag that destroys.
//!
//! Both guards are no-ops under `--force`, and `--dry-run` never
//! reaches them.
