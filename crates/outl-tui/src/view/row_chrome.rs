//! Row chrome — everything a block draws around its own text.
//!
//! The fold slot, the `auto-run::` marker, the pad every non-bullet row
//! spends to reach the text column, and the `key:: value` rows. One
//! module because they are one measurement: change the fold slot and
//! the property row has to move with it, which is exactly the drift
//! [issue 319](https://github.com/outlmd/outl/issues/319) was.
