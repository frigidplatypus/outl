# Build your first outl plugin

This is a hands-on tutorial.
By the end you'll have written, built, installed, and run a real outl plugin — from an empty folder to a working command you trigger from the CLI, the TUI, the desktop app, and mobile.

It's long on purpose.
Nothing is skipped, nothing is assumed.
If you've never written a line of JavaScript for outl, start at the top and follow it straight through.

If you want the dry reference instead of the walkthrough, read [Plugin API](plugin-api.md).
If you want to understand the runtime internals (the Boa engine, the describe→apply model under the hood), read [Plugin architecture](plugin-architecture.md).

## Quickstart — a running plugin in 60 seconds

If you just want to see a plugin run before reading the whole thing, scaffold one and install it:

```sh
outl plugin init hello                       # writes ./hello (manifest + build + a `hello` command)
cd hello
bun install && bun run build                 # bundles src/index.ts → index.js  (npm works too)
outl -w ~/notes plugin install . --yes       # install into your workspace
outl -w ~/notes plugin run com.example.hello hello
```

That last line prints the toast the starter command fires; in the TUI / desktop, type `/hello` in a block instead.
`outl plugin init` writes a complete, buildable project — manifest, `package.json`, `tsconfig`, `src/index.ts`, README — so you have a real plugin to grow from.

The rest of this page builds a plugin **from an empty folder by hand**, so you touch every field and every host call once and nothing is magic.
If you'd rather start from the scaffold and read the reference alongside, that's the [Plugin API](plugin-api.md).

## What we're going to build

We'll build **`tag-counter`** — a small but genuinely useful plugin that exercises both day-zero capabilities you'll reach for most:

- An **op-hook** (`ctx.ops.onOp`) that watches edits as they land and logs whenever a block gains a `#tag`.
- A **slash command** (`ctx.commands.register`) called `count-tags` that scans the workspace, tallies every `#tag`, and writes a tidy report into a `tags/summary` page.

It's a real plugin: it reads blocks, mutates the workspace, reads its own config, logs, and notifies the user.
That covers most of what you'll do in any plugin.

> We deliberately don't reuse the shipped `todo-archiver` example.
> Building something new from scratch is the point — you'll touch every moving part once.

### Prerequisites

You need three things on your machine:

1. **The `outl` CLI**, built and on your `PATH`.
   If you can run `outl --version`, you're set.
   If not, build it from the repo: `cargo build --release -p outl-cli` and use the binary in `target/release/`.
2. **A JavaScript runtime + `esbuild`.**
   We use [`bun`](https://bun.sh) in this tutorial (it's fast and bundles `esbuild`-style builds out of the box), but plain `node` + `npm` works identically.
   Any of these is fine:
   - `bun` installed → `bunx esbuild …`
   - `node` + `npm` installed → `npx esbuild …`
3. **A text editor.**
   TypeScript is recommended (you get types from the SDK), but you can write plain JavaScript if you prefer — the build step is the same.

That's it.
No outl account, no server, no registry — plugins are local files.

## Step 1 — Lay out the folder

A plugin during development has two halves: the **source** you edit (`src/`, TypeScript) and the **bundle** the host actually runs (`index.js`, a single self-contained file).
Create this layout anywhere on disk — call the folder `tag-counter`:

```
tag-counter/
├── plugin.json            # the manifest — what the host reads first
├── package.json           # your build script + the SDK dependency
├── tsconfig.json          # TypeScript config (skip if writing plain JS)
├── config.schema.json     # user-editable settings, described as JSON Schema
└── src/
    └── index.ts           # the plugin code you write
```

After we build, `index.js` (the bundle) lands next to `plugin.json`.
That bundle — plus `plugin.json` and `config.schema.json` — is the *installed shape*: what gets copied into a workspace.
Your `src/` and `node_modules/` never travel with it.

Don't create the files yet — we'll fill each one in below, explaining every field.

## Step 2 — Write the manifest (`plugin.json`)

The manifest is the contract.
The host reads it before it runs a single line of your code: it tells outl who you are, what you plug into, and what you're allowed to touch.
It's validated against [`plugin-v1.json`](schemas/plugin-v1.json) at install time and on every load — point your editor's `$schema` at it for autocomplete.

Create `tag-counter/plugin.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://outl.app/schemas/plugin-v1.json",
  "id": "app.outl.examples.tag-counter",
  "name": "Tag Counter",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "api": "^1.0",
  "engines": {
    "outl": ">=0.7.0"
  },
  "main": "index.js",
  "capabilities": [
    "op-hook",
    "slash-command",
    "config-schema"
  ],
  "permissions": [
    "read-page",
    "write-page",
    "read-op-log",
    "submit-op"
  ],
  "contributes": {
    "commands": [
      {
        "id": "count-tags",
        "title": "Count #tags into a summary page"
      }
    ],
    "configSchema": "config.schema.json"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "description": "Tallies every #tag in the workspace into a summary page.",
    "author": "you",
    "license": "MIT",
    "category": "productivity"
  }
}
```

Field by field:

- **`id`** — your stable, reverse-DNS identity.
  It never changes across versions.
  It's the install directory name *and* the op-log actor stamp (`plugin:app.outl.examples.tag-counter@<device>`), so pick it once and keep it.
  The pattern is enforced: lowercase labels separated by dots, at least two labels.
- **`name`** — the human-readable display name shown in menus.
- **`version`** — semver.
  Bump it when you publish a new build.
- **`api`** — the *plugin API* range you target, **not** the binary version.
  `^1.0` means "any host whose plugin API major is 1".
  A host whose API major doesn't satisfy this refuses to load you — that's the compatibility gate.
- **`engines.outl`** — the minimum outl *binary* version.
  Separate axis from `api`: this tracks the app, `api` tracks the plugin surface.
- **`main`** — the bundled entry file, relative to the plugin root.
  Always a single `.js` file — no `node_modules`, no runtime module resolution.
- **`capabilities`** — what you plug into.
  The loader **intersects** this with what the current client implements; a capability the client can't honor loads partially with a warning, never a crash.
  We declare the three day-zero ones we use.
  (`keybinding` is also declarable — see the note at the end of this step.)
- **`permissions`** — what you're allowed to do.
  The user approves these once on install, and they're frozen in the lockfile.
  Every host call is checked against this set — deny by default.
  We ask for: `read-page` + `read-op-log` to read blocks and watch ops, `write-page` + `submit-op` to write our summary.
- **`contributes.commands`** — the commands you surface in the slash menu / palette.
  Each `id` here must match the id you pass to `ctx.commands.register(...)` at runtime, and the `title` is the label the user sees.
- **`contributes.configSchema`** — a path to a JSON Schema file describing your user-editable settings.
  Day-zero accepts a path only, never an inline schema.
- **`metadata`** — descriptive, non-load-bearing fields for discovery UI.

> **A note on `keybinding`.**
> You *can* declare `contributes.keybindings` (each entry is `{ "command": "<id>", "key": "Ctrl+Shift+T" }`).
> Chord dispatch is **live on the TUI** (a chord fires the command from Normal mode, single or two-chord, unless a native binding already claims it) and on the **desktop** (a native binding always wins).
> Mobile has no keyboard, so it doesn't apply there.
> We leave keybindings out of this tutorial to keep it focused on the two capabilities you'll reach for first, but you can add one to your manifest and it will fire.

## Step 3 — Describe your config (`config.schema.json`)

Our plugin lets the user choose which page the summary lands on.
That's one setting, described as a JSON Schema (draft 2020-12).
Create `tag-counter/config.schema.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "title": "Tag Counter config",
  "type": "object",
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "properties": {
    "summaryPage": {
      "type": "string",
      "title": "Summary page",
      "description": "Slug of the page the tag tally is written to.",
      "default": "tags/summary"
    }
  }
}
```

You read this config at runtime with `ctx.config.get()`.

> **Where the config value actually comes from.**
> `ctx.config.get()` reads the `config` field for your plugin from the workspace lockfile (`installed.json`).
> The user edits it on **every client**: `outl plugin config set <id> <key> <value>` on the CLI, the settings form in the desktop / mobile plugin browser, or the TUI `plugin-settings` overlay.
> All of them render this JSON Schema as a form and coerce each value to its field type, so the schema you write here *is* the settings UI.
> A field marked `"x-outl-secret": true` is routed to the OS keychain instead of the lockfile and read with `ctx.secrets.get()` — see [Plugin API → Secrets, the full flow](plugin-api.md#secrets--the-full-flow).

## Step 4 — Set up the build (`package.json` + `tsconfig.json`)

Create `tag-counter/package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "tag-counter",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "esbuild src/index.ts --bundle --format=iife --platform=neutral --target=es2022 --outfile=index.js",
    "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@outl/plugin-sdk": "workspace:*"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "esbuild": "^0.24.0",
    "typescript": "^6.0.3"
  }
}
```

Two notes on the dependency line:

- `@outl/plugin-sdk` is **types plus one helper** (`definePlugin`) and nothing else — zero runtime code.
  Inside this repo, `workspace:*` resolves it from `plugin-sdk/`.
  If you're building a plugin *outside* the repo, depend on the published package instead: `npm i -D @outl/plugin-sdk` (the `release` workflow publishes it to npm on every release, so `latest` tracks the newest build cut from `main`).

If you're using TypeScript, create `tag-counter/tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "lib": ["ES2022", "DOM"],
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "strict": true,
    "noEmit": true
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

We'll come back to the **build command** in Step 6 — it has the single biggest gotcha in the whole tutorial.
For now, just install dependencies:

```sh
cd tag-counter
bun install      # or: npm install
```

## Step 5 — Write the plugin (`src/index.ts`)

Here's the whole plugin.
Create `tag-counter/src/index.ts`, then read the walkthrough below — every API call is explained.

```ts
import { definePlugin, type LogOp, type PluginContext } from "@outl/plugin-sdk";

/** Our config shape, mirrored by config.schema.json. */
interface TagCounterConfig {
  summaryPage: string;
}

const DEFAULT_SUMMARY_PAGE = "tags/summary";

/** Pull every #tag out of a block's text. Returns lowercase tag names, no `#`. */
function extractTags(text: string): string[] {
  const out: string[] = [];
  const re = /#([a-z0-9][a-z0-9/_-]*)/gi;
  let m: RegExpExecArray | null;
  while ((m = re.exec(text)) !== null) {
    out.push(m[1].toLowerCase());
  }
  return out;
}

export default definePlugin({
  activate(ctx: PluginContext) {
    // 1) op-hook — fires once for every op applied to the log.
    //    We only react to text edits, and only log when a tag appears.
    ctx.ops.onOp((op: LogOp) => {
      if (op.kind !== "Edit" || !op.text) {
        return;
      }
      const tags = extractTags(op.text);
      if (tags.length > 0) {
        ctx.log.info(`block ${op.node} now has tags: ${tags.join(", ")}`);
      }
    });

    // 2) command — fired from the slash menu / palette / `outl plugin run`.
    ctx.commands.register("count-tags", () => {
      const cfg = ctx.config.get<Partial<TagCounterConfig>>();
      const summaryPage =
        cfg?.summaryPage?.trim() || DEFAULT_SUMMARY_PAGE;

      // --- READ PHASE: gather everything from the snapshot, up front. ---
      const blocks = ctx.blocks.query({}); // empty filter = every block
      const counts = new Map<string, number>();
      for (const b of blocks) {
        // Skip the summary page itself so we don't count our own output.
        if (b.page === summaryPage) {
          continue;
        }
        for (const tag of extractTags(b.text)) {
          counts.set(tag, (counts.get(tag) ?? 0) + 1);
        }
      }

      // Sort by count desc, then name, for a stable report.
      const ranked = [...counts.entries()].sort(
        (a, b) => b[1] - a[1] || a[0].localeCompare(b[0]),
      );

      // --- WRITE PHASE: now emit the mutations. ---
      if (ranked.length === 0) {
        ctx.ui.notify("No #tags found in the workspace");
        return;
      }

      // `appendTree` seeds the whole page in a single turn: it creates
      // `summaryPage` if it's missing and threads the new block ids through
      // internally, so we never need a parent id we couldn't obtain mid-turn.
      ctx.page.appendTree(
        summaryPage,
        ranked.map(([tag, n]) => ({ text: `#${tag} — ${n}` })),
      );

      ctx.ui.notify(`Counted ${ranked.length} distinct tag(s)`);
    });
  },
});
```

### Walking through every API call

**`ctx.ops.onOp(cb)`** — registers a hook the host calls once for every op applied to the log, local edits and synced ops alike.
The `op` you receive is `{ kind, node, text?, todo? }`:

- `kind` is one of `"Create" | "Move" | "Edit" | "SetProp" | "SetCollapsed"`.
- `node` is the block id the op acted on (a string).
- `text` and `todo` are populated **only** when `kind === "Edit"` — that's the op that carries a block's new text and TODO state.

So our hook bails unless it's an `Edit` with text, then scans for tags.
This needs the `read-op-log` permission and the `op-hook` capability — both of which we declared.

**`ctx.commands.register(id, handler)`** — wires the `count-tags` handler to the command we declared in `contributes.commands`.
The id **must** match.
The handler is `() => void | Promise<void>` — sync is fine here.
It fires when the user picks the command from the slash menu, the palette, or runs `outl plugin run`.

**`ctx.config.get()`** — returns your plugin's config object (read from the lockfile, as noted in Step 3).
We fall back to the default page when it's unset.

**`ctx.blocks.query(filter)`** → `Block[]` — finds blocks.
The filter is `{ page?, todo?, textContains?, prop? }`, all optional and ANDed; an empty `{}` matches every block.
`prop` matches blocks whose properties equal **every** `key → value` pair exactly (flattened strings, no substring, no case folding; a block missing a key never matches).
Each `Block` is `{ id, text, todo?, page, properties? }` — note `text` is **clean**, with no `TODO `/`DONE ` prefix, and `properties` is a flat `key → value` map (list values flattened to `"a, b"`), absent when the block has none.
Needs `read-page`.

**`ctx.page.appendTree(slug, tree)`** — appends a whole `TreeNode[]` (`{ text, children? }`, recursive) under a page, creating the page if it's missing.
This is the call that lets us seed a brand-new `tags/summary` page in a single run: it creates the page and all the tally blocks in one turn, threading the new block ids through internally.
Needs `write-page`.

**`ctx.ui.notify(msg)`** and **`ctx.log.info(msg)`** — user-facing toast / status line, and a line in the host's plugin log, respectively.
Neither needs a permission.

### The one thing that trips everyone: describe → apply

This is the single most important mental model in the plugin runtime, so read it twice.

**Reads come from a snapshot taken at the start of the turn.**
**Writes are buffered and applied by the host *after* your handler returns.**

Concretely:

- `ctx.blocks.query(...)`, `ctx.blocks.get(...)`, `ctx.page.list()`, `ctx.config.get()` all read from a frozen snapshot of the workspace as it was when your command started.
- `ctx.blocks.edit/create/move/...`, `ctx.page.create(...)` don't take effect immediately.
  They're queued, and the host drains the queue and applies each one (permission-gated) only once your handler has finished.

The practical consequence: **a mutation you make is NOT visible to a `query` later in the same command.**
The snapshot never changes mid-turn.
If you `create` a block and then `query`, the new block won't be in the results.

The rule that follows: **collect everything you're going to change first (the read phase), then emit all your mutations (the write phase).**
Our `count-tags` does exactly that — it builds the full `counts` map from the snapshot before it creates a single block.
Don't interleave reads and writes expecting to see your own changes; you won't.

### Why `appendTree` and not `create`

`ctx.blocks.create(parentId, text)` needs a **parent block id**, and describe→apply is exactly why that bites here.
A page you create this turn has no block you can address yet — it doesn't materialize until after your handler returns.
`ctx.page.appendTree(slug, tree)` is the escape hatch: the host applies the tree *and* creates the page if missing in one pass, threading the new ids internally, so you seed a brand-new page in a single run — no "run it twice" rough edge.

The other write calls are still the right tool when you already hold block ids:

- `ctx.blocks.create(parentId, text)` / `createAfter(afterId, text)` when you have a real parent or sibling id (e.g. one you got from `query`).
- `ctx.blocks.move(id, { toPage })` to relocate existing blocks onto a page — it takes a page slug and creates the page if missing (this is what the shipped `todo-archiver` example does).

Rule of thumb: **new content on a fresh page → `appendTree`; editing or relocating blocks you already found → `create` / `move`.**

The host API you have to work with, in full:

| Call | What it does | Permission |
|---|---|---|
| `ctx.ops.onOp(cb)` | hook every applied op | `read-op-log` |
| `ctx.commands.register(id, h)` | wire a command handler | — |
| `ctx.blocks.query(filter)` → `Block[]` | find blocks | `read-page` |
| `ctx.blocks.get(id)` → `Block \| null` | one block by id | `read-page` |
| `ctx.blocks.edit(id, text)` | replace text (include `TODO `/`DONE ` to keep a prefix) | `write-page` + `submit-op` |
| `ctx.blocks.create(parentId, text)` | new last child | `write-page` + `submit-op` |
| `ctx.blocks.createAfter(afterId, text)` | new sibling after a block | `write-page` + `submit-op` |
| `ctx.blocks.appendTree(parentId, tree)` | append a nested `TreeNode[]` under a block, one turn | `write-page` + `submit-op` |
| `ctx.blocks.move(id, target)` | `{ toPage }` (creates page) or `{ toParent }` | `write-page` + `submit-op` |
| `ctx.blocks.toggleTodo(id)` | cycle None→TODO→DONE→None | `write-page` + `submit-op` |
| `ctx.blocks.delete(id)` | move to trash | `write-page` + `submit-op` |
| `ctx.page.list()` → `Page[]` | `{ slug, title, kind }` | `read-page` |
| `ctx.page.create(slug)` | idempotent page create | `write-page` |
| `ctx.page.appendTree(slug, tree)` | append a `TreeNode[]`, creating the page if missing | `write-page` |
| `ctx.config.get()` | your config object | — |
| `ctx.log.info/warn/error(m)` | host log | — |
| `ctx.ui.notify(m)` | user toast / status line | — |

> **Also available** (beyond the table above): `ctx.storage.{get,set,delete}` is per-plugin local KV (gated by `storage:local`, stored at `<workspace>/.outl/plugins/<id>/storage.json`, never syncs), and `ctx.net.fetch(url, opts)` does a **blocking** HTTP request gated by `network:<domain>` (a denied domain returns `{ ok: false, error }` instead of throwing).
> `ctx.content.register(lang, fn)` registers a renderer for a fenced block language, and `ctx.sync.register({ push, pull })` registers a sync transport (the core path is live; client polling is still roadmap).

## Step 6 — Build the bundle (read this carefully)

The host runs your bundle as a **plain script**, not as an ES module.
That means the build **must** emit an IIFE, not ESM.

Run this from inside `tag-counter/`:

```sh
bunx esbuild src/index.ts --bundle --format=iife --platform=neutral --target=es2022 --outfile=index.js
# or, with npm:
npx esbuild src/index.ts --bundle --format=iife --platform=neutral --target=es2022 --outfile=index.js
# or just use the script you defined:
bun run build
```

> **⚠️ Gotcha #1 — `--format=iife` is mandatory.**
> If you build with `--format=esm`, esbuild emits `export` statements.
> The outl engine evaluates the bundle as a script with no module loader, so an `export` is a syntax error in that context and your plugin **silently fails to load** (or loads with a confusing error).
> The symptom is "my command never shows up."
> The fix is always: rebuild with `--format=iife`.
> This is the number-one mistake people hit.

How `definePlugin` reaches the host through the IIFE: the SDK's `definePlugin(def)` calls `globalThis.__outl_register(def)`, which the engine installs *before* it evaluates your bundle.
The IIFE runs top-to-bottom, hits your `export default definePlugin({...})`, the helper registers your definition with the host, and the host then calls `activate(ctx)` with the real context.
You never `export` anything the host consumes — registration happens through that global, which is exactly why ESM's `export` machinery is unnecessary (and breaks things).

After a successful build you'll have `tag-counter/index.js`.
That, plus `plugin.json` and `config.schema.json`, is your installable plugin.

## Step 7 — Install it

Pick (or create) a workspace to install into.
If you don't have one:

```sh
outl init ~/notes-test
```

Then install your plugin from its directory.
`github:` install sources aren't wired yet — you install from a **local directory** for now:

```sh
outl -w ~/notes-test plugin install ~/path/to/tag-counter --yes
```

What happens:

- outl parses `plugin.json` and validates it against the schema.
- It computes the bundle hash (stored for integrity — revalidated on every load).
- It shows you the permissions the plugin requests and asks for approval.
  `--yes` approves everything non-interactively (required when stdin isn't a TTY, e.g. in scripts).
  Drop `--yes` to see the prompt and approve by hand.
- It copies the installed shape into `~/notes-test/.outl/plugins/app.outl.examples.tag-counter/` and freezes the approved permission set in the lockfile (`installed.json`).

Confirm it's there:

```sh
outl -w ~/notes-test plugin list
```

You should see your plugin, its version, `enabled`, and the `/count-tags` command it contributes.

## Step 8 — Run it

Let's give it something to count.
Seed a couple of blocks with tags:

```sh
outl -w ~/notes-test page create inbox --title Inbox
outl -w ~/notes-test block append --page inbox --text "ship the thing #work #urgent"
outl -w ~/notes-test block append --page inbox --text "read the paper #research"
```

Now run the command from the CLI:

```sh
outl -w ~/notes-test plugin run app.outl.examples.tag-counter count-tags
```

`plugin run` executes the command and then **re-renders every `.md`** so the mutation lands on disk (the op log is the source of truth; the `.md` files are a projection of it).
You'll see the notification text in the output.

### Where the command shows up in the GUI clients

The same plugin, same command, surfaces everywhere a person edits:

- **TUI** — press `/` to open the slash menu; `/count-tags` appears alongside the built-ins.
- **Desktop** — click the `⧉` button in the bottom corner to open the Plugin palette and pick the command.
- **Mobile** — tap the plugin glyph in the header to open the plugin sheet.

`op-hook` and `slash-command` both work end-to-end on all four clients (TUI, desktop, mobile, CLI), so your `onOp` log line and your `count-tags` command behave identically everywhere.

## Step 9 — Iterate fast with dev mode

Reinstalling after every code change is tedious.
For authoring, drop your plugin into the workspace's `_dev/` directory instead:

```
~/notes-test/.outl/plugins/_dev/tag-counter/
├── plugin.json
├── index.js
└── config.schema.json
```

A plugin in `_dev/`:

- **Loads without the hash check** — edit `index.js`, reload, no reinstall.
- **Runs with all permissions implicit** — you're not prompted on every iteration.
- **Is excluded from sync** — your in-progress hacking doesn't leak to your other devices.

The clients show a "sandbox relaxed" banner so it's obvious you're running unvetted dev code.
The loop becomes: edit `src/index.ts` → `bun run build` → copy `index.js` into `_dev/tag-counter/` → reload the client.
(You can symlink or script that copy.)
This is for authoring only — ship the real, hash-pinned install when you're done.

## Step 10 — Debug when it doesn't work

Where output goes:

- **`ctx.log.info/warn/error`** and any `console.log` in your code go to the **host's plugin log** (and surface in each client's log view).
  This is your primary debugging channel.
- **`ctx.ui.notify`** shows the user-facing message (status line / toast) — good for confirming a run happened, not for debugging detail.
- **Load and runtime errors** surface as a warning in `outl plugin list` (a plugin that fails to load is reported, never hidden) and in the client's plugin log.

Common failures and what they mean:

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Command never appears | Bundle built as ESM (`export` in `index.js`) | Rebuild with `--format=iife` |
| Command never appears | `contributes.commands[].id` ≠ the id passed to `ctx.commands.register` | Make the two ids identical |
| "permission denied" / write does nothing | You called a host method whose permission you didn't request | Add the permission to `plugin.json`, reinstall (you'll re-approve) |
| Install rejected: invalid id | `id` doesn't match reverse-DNS (`a.b`, lowercase, ≥2 labels) | Fix the `id` pattern |
| Install rejected: `github:` source | `github:` isn't wired yet | Install from a local directory |
| `ctx.storage` / `ctx.net` call throws "permission denied" | You didn't declare `storage:local` / `network:<domain>` | Add the permission to `plugin.json`, reinstall (you'll re-approve) |
| Your own write doesn't show in a later `query` | describe→apply: reads are from the start-of-turn snapshot | Read everything first, then write |
| `onOp` never fires | Missing `read-op-log` permission or `op-hook` capability | Declare both in `plugin.json` |

When in doubt, sprinkle `ctx.log.info(...)` through your handler and watch the plugin log.

## Next steps

You've now built, installed, and run a plugin end to end.
Where to go from here:

- **[Plugin API](plugin-api.md)** — the full authoring reference: every host method, the manifest in detail, `definePlugin`, versioning, and the permission model.
- **[Plugins](plugins.md)** — the *user* side: installing, pinning, updating, approving permissions, and where plugins live on disk.
- **[`plugin-v1.json`](schemas/plugin-v1.json)** — the JSON Schema your `plugin.json` is validated against.
- **[Plugin architecture](plugin-architecture.md)** — how the runtime works under the hood (the Boa JS engine, the describe→apply host loop).
  The deepest internals live in the `outl-plugins` crate notes.

### A word on distribution

Three ways to share a plugin, from least to most public:

- **A built directory** — hand someone the folder (`plugin.json` + `index.js` + `config.schema.json`) and they run `outl plugin install <dir>`.
- **A GitHub repo** — `outl plugin install github:user/repo` clones it at the newest semver tag (or `…#v1.2.0` to pin one).
  No registry entry needed.
- **The official registry** — list it in [`outlmd/registry`](https://github.com/outlmd/registry) so it shows up in the in-app marketplace and `outl plugin search`.
  See [Plugins → Publishing your plugin](plugins.md#publishing-your-plugin-registering-it) for the four-step flow.

Still roadmap: **`.outlpkg`** single-file packages and `outl plugin update`.
