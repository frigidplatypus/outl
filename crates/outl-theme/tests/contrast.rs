//! Contrast, which no other test in this crate can see.
//!
//! `tokens.rs` answers structural questions: does this token name have a
//! `Palette` field behind it, does a component use one that does not.
//! A field can pass every one of those and still be unreadable, because
//! none of them knows which two fields get painted on top of each other.
//!
//! This file owns that question, and it is split out rather than living
//! beside them because it needs a different toolkit (WCAG relative
//! luminance) and a different kind of exemption list (a preset to fix,
//! not a name to rename).

/// Every `_bg` / `_fg` pair in every preset clears WCAG AA (4.5:1).
///
/// A palette field can be a valid hex, have a `@theme` token, be used by
/// a real component, and still be unreadable. None of the other tests in
/// this file can see that, because none of them knows which two fields
/// are painted on top of each other.
///
/// This is not hypothetical either. `text-white` on `bg-(--color-outl-accent)`
/// shipped on twelve mobile surfaces and failed AA on **seven of the ten
/// presets**, including `outl`, the default: 2.72:1, which misses even
/// the 3.0 large-text floor, and 1.38:1 on `dracula`. Nothing caught it
/// because "white" is not a palette field, so no test was looking.
///
/// `accent` carries a real `accent_fg` now, and that is the second half of
/// the same story. It used to be checked against `bg` alone, on the
/// argument that an accent is chosen to contrast with the canvas so the
/// canvas reads back on it — true in nine of ten presets, which is
/// precisely the shape of a missing field rather than a safe asymmetry.
/// The clients spelled that argument out loud as `text-(--color-outl-bg)`,
/// the canvas colour used as a text colour, on eighteen surfaces.
///
/// Both pairs are checked, because they are different questions. `accent
/// on bg` is about the fills that genuinely paint the canvas on accent
/// (`selected_bullet`, `status_normal`, `list_selected` all reuse it);
/// `accent` is about the foreground a client paints on an accent button.
///
/// **`monokai` is the documented exception — for `accent on bg` only.**
/// Its accent `#f92672` against its own `bg` is 3.93:1: over the 3.0
/// large-text floor, under AA. That is a flaw in the preset's accent, not
/// in the token model, so it is exempted by name rather than papered over
/// by lowering the bar for everyone. Its `accent_fg` is **not** exempt and
/// does not need to be: a real field let it pick `#000000` and reach
/// 5.55:1, which is the whole argument for having the field.
