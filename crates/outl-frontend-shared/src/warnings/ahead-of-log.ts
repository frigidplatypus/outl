 * Kept as a pure function rather than inline JSX because the two clients
 * must say the *same* thing about the same state, and because the piece
 * that actually matters here is the wording — a banner nobody
 * understands is the same defect as no banner at all, which is what this
 * state had before (the refusal died in a backend `tracing::warn!`).
 *
 * The only legitimate difference between clients is the recovery: the
 * desktop user has a terminal in the same folder, an iPhone user has no
 * `outl` binary at all. Inventing a mobile button that doesn't work
 * would be worse than saying so plainly.
 *
 * Background: root `CLAUDE.md` invariant 8, `docs/rfcs/0210-md-content-outside-op-log.md`.
