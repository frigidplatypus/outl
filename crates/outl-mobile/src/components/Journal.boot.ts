/**
 * The two paths that open the workspace: the boot load behind the
 * skeleton, and the P2P pull-then-reload every refresh affordance and
 * every poll shares.
 *
 * **Why they are one module.** Both are the same four moves — force a
 * sync, open a page, decide whether the reply may replace what is on
 * screen — and both are the only places that hold a user-visible gate
 * open (`loaded` for the skeleton, `syncing` for the two refresh
 * affordances). A gate that is set on one path and cleared on another is
 * how a stall becomes permanent.
 *
 * **Why every call is capped.** On iOS `wry` serves Tauri IPC from the
 * main thread and a non-`async` command runs there, so one slow
 * workspace load pins the UI thread; the app was being SIGKILLed by the
 * scene-update watchdog (0x8BADF00D) with the main thread inside a sync
 * command. A `withTimeout` here does **not** free that thread — only the
 * Rust side can — but it frees the *gate*, which is the difference
 * between a skeleton the user can retry out of and one that never ends.
 * So: no `await` in here is uncapped, and every gate is cleared in a
 * `finally`.
 *
 * `Journal.boot.test.ts` drives both, including the two states that used
 * to be unreachable: a never-settling open, and a sync pass that throws.
 *
 * **And the order they run in** ({@link runBootSequence}), because that
 * order was the whole complaint: the journal was behind a force-sync that
 * dialled every peer first.

 * dialling early starts punching the NAT path sooner. True, and paid for
 * with the only thing the user is actually waiting for: `outl_sync_now`
 * dials every known peer, and on iOS `wry` serves Tauri IPC from the main
 * thread, so that dial ran on the thread that had to draw today's
 * journal. A first sync 300ms later costs nothing a user can name; a
 * first paint two seconds later is the entire complaint.
 *
 * Dialling first is still what opens a path to a phone behind carrier
 * NAT, so it is not dropped — it moved behind the paint, where
 * `firstSync` is the same mobile-initiated dial one frame later.
 *
 * **Why `painted` and not just "after the await".** `load` resolving
 * means the signals are set, not that anything is on screen: Solid has
 * applied the DOM mutations and the frame has not been presented yet. A
 * command issued in that continuation lands on the main thread *before*
 * the pixels, which is the bug reordering was supposed to fix.
 *
 * `deepLink` stays awaited, ahead of the two background steps: it may
 * navigate away from today, and `firstSync` reopens whatever page is
 * current when it starts — so letting them race flips a cold-start deep
 * link back to the journal. Waiting on it is also why it is in a
 * `finally`: the sync and the tickers are not the deep link's
 * dependents, and a drain that throws must not leave a running app with
 * no peer poll and no reminder delivery.
