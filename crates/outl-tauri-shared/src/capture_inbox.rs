//! `drain_capture_inbox`: the only path from a capture inbox
//! (RFC 0363) into the workspace. Each capture lands through
//! `outl_actions::capture` and is projected like any typed block, then
//! its file is deleted.
//!
//! Two inboxes, drained in that order: the one a mobile shell exports in
//! `OUTL_CAPTURE_INBOX` (the iOS App Group container, Android's
//! `filesDir`), then the open workspace's own `.outl/captures`, which is
//! where `outl capture` writes. A client registers this command once and
//! gets whichever of the two its platform actually has — the desktop has
//! only the second, iOS only the first, Android both.
