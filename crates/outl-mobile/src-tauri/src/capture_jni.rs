//! Android's side of the capture inbox (RFC 0363).
//!
//! The share target writes a capture the same way the iOS extensions do,
//! except it can do it through Rust: on Android the widget, the share
//! target and the quick settings tile are components of this app, in
//! this process, with this library already loaded. So
//! [`outl_actions::capture::write_capture`] stays the single owner of
//! the inbox file format here, and Kotlin only supplies the folder and
//! the text (`OutlCapture.kt`).
//!
//! That is the one place Android deliberately differs from iOS, where a
//! widget and a share extension are separate processes under a memory
//! ceiling this library would not fit, and a small Swift writer
//! (`OutlKit/Capture/CaptureInbox.swift`) owns the format instead.
//!
//! Nothing here touches a workspace. The capture waits in the inbox
//! until `drain_capture_inbox` turns it into ops, which is what keeps
//! root invariant 7 — a second process must never append to the op log.

/// Compose one line out of what the share sheet handed over and write
/// it into the inbox folder Kotlin passes in.
///
/// `text` and `url` are the two things an Android `ACTION_SEND` can
/// carry, and `outl_actions::capture::shared_line` is the one owner of
/// how they become a single line — so Kotlin holds neither that rule nor
/// the file format, only the folder and the strings. Either may be
/// empty; both empty is "nothing to save".
///
/// `JNI_FALSE` means nothing was published: blank text, an unreadable
/// argument, or a failed write. The caller shows that as "nothing
/// saved" rather than claiming a line it does not have — a capture that
/// silently disappears is the failure RFC 0363 exists to avoid.
///
/// Style follows `bg_sync.rs` and `android_jni.rs`: `EnvUnowned` +
/// `with_env` (which wraps the body in `catch_unwind`) +
/// [`jni::errors::LogErrorAndDefault`] (which logs, never throws). A
/// thrown exception would land inside the share activity and crash the
/// share sheet; a panic unwinding into the JVM would abort the process.
/// Both are worse answers than "could not save that".
///
/// # Safety
///
/// Called by the JVM with a valid JNI env, class and three non-null
/// `String` arguments.
