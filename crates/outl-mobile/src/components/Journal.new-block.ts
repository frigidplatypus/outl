/**
 * The two block creates that start from a tap taken with the keyboard
 * down: "+" / "Add a block" / "Tap to start writing" (append at the end
 * of the page) and the long-press menu's "New block above".
 *
 * They live together because of what they share, which is not the
 * create — it is the keyboard. Both are two awaits deep (commit the
 * open draft, then `create_block` over IPC) before the new block's
 * textarea can mount and focus itself, and on iOS a `.focus()` that
 * late raises no keyboard. So both arm the keyboard **synchronously,
 * before the first await**, and both carry whatever the user typed
 * during the round-trip into the block they just created.
 * `lib/keyboard-keeper.ts` owns the mechanism and the reasoning.
 *
 * `handleCreateAfter` deliberately stays in `Journal.tsx`: it is a
 * split at the caret, and every way to reach it (Return inside a
 * block, the keyboard bar's "New line") already has the keyboard up,
 * so it has none of this problem.
 *
 * Handed accessors, never values — a destructured prop (or dep) freezes
 * at first render in Solid. No handler reads `this`, so `Journal` can
 * pass them straight to a child as props.
