//! Land the captures `outl capture` left in the inbox (RFC 0363).
//!
//! The terminal is where `outl capture` is run from — by hand, from a
//! shell alias, from a macOS Service or a hotkey daemon — so the TUI not
//! draining would make the command's promise false for the client most
//! likely to be open. Every GUI client drains on mount and on every
//! return to the foreground; the TUI drains once, at boot, which is the
//! only moment it has (nothing here watches the inbox).
//!
//! `outl_actions::capture` owns the landing: the journal for the day the
//! capture was *made*, in capture order, idempotent on a crash. This
//! module is the three things around it the TUI has to do itself —
//! project the pages that gained blocks, reload the open view off that
//! projection, and say so.
